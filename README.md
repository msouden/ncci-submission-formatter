# ncci-submission-formatter

A script I made for a company I worked for over 2018-2019 in the work comp industry.

WHen run, this script took data from two sources, comparing multiple datapoints to match values, it then re-segmented, added unique values, reformatted date and timestamps, and generated a whitespace delimited machine readable file, and an error log for failures in data matches or absent data.

Please note: 

- all data in this repo is manufactured sample data. This repo contains no actual health or claims data.
- This was an internal tool used to manipulate and process work comp claims data - which is not covered under HIPAA regulation, but also did not transmit heath data.
